# Lem-in

## Project overview

Project of school 42: let all ants pass from room start to the room end through the shortest way.

The program receives the data describing the ant farm from the standard output
in the following format:
```number_of_ants
   the_rooms
   the_links
```

## Mandatory part

### Validation (according to common sense)
Comments starts with only one '#'. Comments can be at any line.
Comments are treated on the begining of the line only `_#` will not be considered as a proper comment and 
result in error.

The number of ants must be integer, can contain spaces or tabs; any other characters will be considered as 
error.

## Notes for myself:
There is double declaration in files of lem_in.h (browsing in clion)
